Comparison with altimetric data

includes MATLAB script for comparing altimetric river water level to CaMa-Flood sfcelv (Water Surface Elevation) and rivout (Q/Discharge) for two basins of Niger and Ganges-Brahmaputra.
the comparison is in two manners:
  1. comparing the 1st temporal components for altimetric data and CaMa-Flood outputs. 
  2. comparing time series of some virtual stations to the closest (spatialy) CaMa-Flood output.


Runoff Regionalization

includes MATLAB script for trimming global runoff NetCDF files on the two basins of Niger and Ganges-Brahmaputra and exporting the outputs in NetCDF files.
