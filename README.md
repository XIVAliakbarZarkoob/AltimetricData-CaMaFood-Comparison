# Comparison with Altimetric Data
Contains MATLAB scripts for comparing altimetric river water level data with CaMa-Flood model outputs (sfcelv: Water Surface Elevation, and rivout: Discharge) for the Niger and Ganges-Brahmaputra river basins.

The comparison is performed in two ways:

  1. The first temporal components from altimetric data and CaMa-Flood outputs are extracted and compared.
  2. Time series from selected virtual stations are compared to the closest spatial CaMa-Flood output.

The CaMa-Flood output files required for running this script is stored of google drive accessible with the link below:

# Runoff Regionalization
Contains MATLAB scripts for regionalizing global runoff data. The script trims global NetCDF runoff files on the Niger and Ganges-Brahmaputra basins and export the results as new NetCDF files.
